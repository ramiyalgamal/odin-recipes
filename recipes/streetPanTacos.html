  <p>These are truly the easiest sheet pan tacos you will ever make. High temperature roasting on a sheet pan makes them crisp and golden, and the beef filling does not need pre-cooking. Try themâ€”you'll be amazed. Top with your favorite taco toppings.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more if needed</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

    <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>10 corn tortillas</li>
    <li>1 cup refried beans (optional)</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment paper and lightly coat with 1 tablespoon olive oil. </li>
    <li>Combine beef, onion, green chiles, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a medium bowl and mix until well incorporated. </li>
    <li>Wrap tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave just until softened, about 30 seconds. </li>
    <li>Spread about 3 tablespoons beef mixture over half of a tortilla in a very thin layer that reaches to the edges  Spread about 1 tablespoon beans onto the other half. Sprinkle all over with about 2 tablespoons cheese. Fold tortilla in half to make a taco; place on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining tortillas, meat and cheese. Brush tops of tacos with remaining oil. </li>
    <li>Bake tacos in the preheated oven, flipping halfway through, until lightly browned, toasted, and crisp around the edges, 30 to 35 minutes. Serve with desired toppings.</li>
